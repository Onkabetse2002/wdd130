                Hi, my name is Onkabetse Galehole, and I am from Kuruman, a small but beautiful town
                in the Northern Cape of South Africa. Growing up there has been such a big part of
                who I am. It's a place full of history, culture, and incredible people.
                Right now, I'm studying Software Development at BYU-Idaho. I have always been fascinated
                by technology and how it can solve real-world problems, so diving into this field feels like 
                the perfect fit for me. I am learning everything from coding to software engineering, and it is
                exciting to see how these skills can open doors to creating impactful solutions.
                I am all about challenging myself and growing, both personally and professionally. I really 
                believe in the power of working with others, staying curious, and always giving my best. My 
                goal is to make a difference in the tech world while staying true to my roots and the values 
                that shaped me.
